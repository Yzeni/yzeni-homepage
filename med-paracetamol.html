    <h1>Paracetamol (Acetaminophen)</h1>

    <section>
      <h2>Description</h2>
      <p>Paracetamol, also known as acetaminophen, is a widely used analgesic and antipyretic agent.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>Clinical Pharmacology</h2>
      <p>Paracetamol works centrally to inhibit prostaglandin synthesis, resulting in pain relief and fever reduction without significant anti-inflammatory effects.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>Clinical Studies</h2>
      <p>Studies show paracetamol is effective for mild to moderate pain and fever, with rapid onset and low gastrointestinal risk compared to NSAIDs.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>Indication and Usage</h2>
      <p>Used for the relief of fever, headaches, muscle aches, arthritis, backache, toothaches, colds, and menstrual cramps.</p>
    </section>

    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>Warnings</h2>

    <section>
      <h2>Drug Abuse and Dependence</h2>
      <p>Paracetamol does not cause dependence or abuse. However, intentional overdose for self-harm is a known risk.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
